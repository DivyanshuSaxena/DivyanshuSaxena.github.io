abstract = {Serverless platforms today impose rigid trade-offs between
resource use and user-perceived performance. Limited controls, provided via toggling sandboxes between warm and
cold states and keep-alives, force operators to sacrifice significant resources to achieve good performance. We present a
serverless framework, Medes, that breaks the rigid trade-off
and allows operators to navigate the trade-off space smoothly.
Medes leverages the fact that the warm sandboxes running
on serverless platforms have a high fraction of duplication in
their memory footprints. We exploit these redundant chunks
to develop a new sandbox state, called a dedup state, that
is more memory-efficient than the warm state and faster to
restore from than the cold state. We develop novel mechanisms to identify memory redundancy at minimal overhead
while ensuring that the dedup containers' memory footprint
is small. Finally, we develop a simple sandbox management
policy that exposes a narrow, intuitive interface for operators
to trade-off performance for memory by jointly controlling
warm and dedup sandboxes. Detailed experiments with a
protoformat using real-world serverless workloads demonstrate
that Medes can provide up to 1X-2.75X improvements in the
end-to-end latencies. The benefits of Medes are enhanced in
memory pressure situations, where Medes can provide up to
3.8X improvements in end-to-end latencies. Medes achieves
this by reducing the number of cold starts incurred by 10-50%
against the state-of-the-art baselines.},

abstract = {Distributed applications on the cloud are being developed
and deployed as microservices as opposed to the monolithic architecture.
Service Meshes have emerged as a way of specifying communication
policies between microservices. Service Meshes have the potential
to abstract the networking requirements of distributed applications
from the application logic. However, current service mesh frameworks
introduce significant performance and resource overheads.
We study the overheads of service meshes and make a case for redesigning
both the control plane and data plane for service meshes.
First, we propose the notion of Application Defined Middleboxes,
which makes it possible for the mesh control planes to reduce the
overheads by optimizing where to implement application policies.
Second, we demonstrate preliminary ideas on accelerating the data
plane to further reduce the overheads.},
