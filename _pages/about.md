I am a graduate student at the [Department of Computer Sciences](https://cs.utexas.edu){:target="_blank"}, [University of Texas at Austin](https://utexas.edu){:target="_blank"}.
I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Aditya Akella](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~akella/) at the UT Networked Systems ([UTNS](https://utns.cs.utexas.edu/)) lab.
Earlier I was an RA in the same group at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.  

I am broadly interested in Systems and Networking, with a focus on understanding the fundamental challenges that the current networked systems face. My current focus is on identifying and developing systems level interventions to facilitate fast, easily configurable and easily deployable solutions for the upcoming Internet.  

I'm fascinated by questions such as "Can we bring datacenter-like capabilities to the end-users?" or "What are the fundamental constraints in the networking devices we use?". As a long term goal, it is my desire to bridge the gap between research and ground reality by working on socially utilizable projects.

Previously, I was an undergraduate student at the [Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi](https://home.iitd.ac.in/){:target="_blank"} majoring in [Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.iitd.ac.in){:target="_blank"} where I met and made friends with some absolutely amazing and competent people. I hail from [Lucknow](https://goo.gl/maps/yNiHPh9WgNbjwPeH9){:target="_blank"}, a city in North India.

**_I am actively seeking internships for Summer 2022._**
