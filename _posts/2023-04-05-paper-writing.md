I have been meaning to write some (at least one) blog for my website for
quite some time now. Occasionally, I stumble across some really insightful
realizations, but procrastination usually takes over and those insights
never get to see the light of the day. So, this time, when I was pondering
what to write upon, a natural question was 'what is even the benefit of writing?'.  

It turns out to be a happy coincidence that lately I have been involved in a
lot of academic writing - papers, short papers, course project reports, etc.
and I have realized that such academic writing actually helps in several ways.
So this first blog post is dedicated to the 'importance of academic writing'.  

Below I am jotting down pointers that I feel make academic writing useful:

<ul>
    <li><strong>Clarity of thought:</strong> Writing down ideas clears the thought process.
    Spending time over things that otherwise seem daunting, streamlines the thought
    process. Things that seem overly-complicated become simpler and things that
    one might take lightly show their true colors.</li>
    <li><strong>Diverse Summarization:</strong> A lot of academic writing can
    be thought of as various lengths of pitches. (In reference to Computer Science
    Papers:) The Abstract section is like an elevator pitch, the Introduction
    section is like a lightning talk, the Evaluation (or Results) section can be
    thought of as an Impact script. Writing these gives us pointers on how to
    convey our idea to a wide variety of audiences by giving the right points for
    the right audience.</li>
    <li><strong>Highlight key points:</strong> I have realized that writing good academic papers
    is a lot about conveying the key points in the right manner. Parts of the project/
    idea that took the most time might not be the key highlights of the project.
    Identifying the `challenging' parts from the `interesting' parts of a project is
    the key to effective impactful communication - whether written, visual, or verbal.</li>
</ul>
